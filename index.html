    </div>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h4>How the components were selected?</h4>

    <h4>1. Strain gauge</h4>
    <p>
      To reduce excitation power while maintaining good signal sensitivity, <b>1000 Ω quarter-bridge strain gauges</b> were selected.
      Compared to typical 120 Ω / 350 Ω gauges, the higher resistance significantly reduces current draw, improving overall battery
      life without compromising measurement quality.
    </p>

    <h4>2. ADC + Amplification</h4>
    <p>
      For signal amplification and analog-to-digital conversion, the <b>Texas Instruments 24-bit ADC</b> was selected.
      This device integrates a high-resolution multi-channel ADC along with an internal programmable gain amplifier (PGA),
      making it well-suited for low-level strain gauge measurements.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">The ADC was chosen primarily because it supports:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simultaneous multi-channel sampling, enabling synchronised strain measurements across multiple sensors</li>
      <li>High resolution conversion, allowing accurate capture of microvolt-level strain signals</li>
      <li>Integrated PGA, reducing the need for external analog amplification stages</li>
      <li>Low noise performance, improving measurement stability and repeatability</li>
      <li>SPI digital interface, simplifying MCU communication and data acquisition</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Microcontroller</h4>
    <p>
      The <b>STM32 ultra-low-power microcontroller</b> was selected as the main control unit of the strain gauge instrumentation system.
      It was responsible for coordinating data acquisition, managing system calibration, and implementing power-optimised operation
      for long-term field deployment.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">The STM32 MCU was chosen primarily due to its:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ultra-low power architecture, enabling extended battery life in remote environments</li>
      <li>SPI peripheral support, required for reliable communication with the 24-bit ADC</li>
      <li>Sufficient Flash and RAM, for firmware, calibration storage, and acquisition logic</li>
      <li>Robust GPIO and timer peripherals, useful for system control, synchronization, and debugging</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Excitation Source</h4>
    <p>
      A stable and low-noise excitation source was critical to ensure accurate and repeatable strain measurements, since any variation
      in bridge excitation directly affects the measured output voltage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitation stage was implemented using a <b>3 V LDO regulator</b>, which provided a clean and regulated excitation supply
      for the Wheatstone bridge. This ensured stable operation under battery voltage variation, reduced supply ripple, and improved
      overall measurement consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the LDO-based excitation approach provided a reliable and low-noise bridge supply, supporting accurate strain measurements
      in harsh field conditions.
    </p>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h4>What was the Gain Selection &amp; Amplification Strategy?</h4>
    <p>
      Since quarter-bridge strain gauge outputs are typically in the microvolt to millivolt range, gain selection was critical to maximise ADC
      resolution without saturating the input. The system gain was selected based on two key factors: <b>offset tolerance of strain gauges</b>
      and the expected <b>full-scale strain range</b>.
    </p>

    <h4>Offset-Based Gain Validation (Datasheet)</h4>
    <p>
      From the strain-gauge datasheet, the strain gauge resistance tolerance is <b>1000 ± 4 Ω</b>, meaning worst-case gauge resistance can be
      996 Ω to 1004 Ω. This produces a worst-case bridge offset of approximately:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>+3.7 mV</li>
      <li>−3.7 mV</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This was calculated using the bridge output voltage error relative to the 1.5 V reference level. The 24-bit ADC full-scale range (FSR)
      for different gain settings was evaluated:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gain 16 → ±75 mV</li>
      <li>Gain 32 → ±37.5 mV</li>
      <li>Gain 64 → ±18.75 mV</li>
      <li>Gain 128 → ±9.375 mV</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, based on datasheet offsets alone, all gain settings would remain within range.</p>

    <h4>Offset-Based Gain Validation (Experimental Testing)</h4>
    <p>
      To validate real-world offsets, experimental testing was performed across <b>7 sets</b> of strain measurement systems, each containing
      <b>21 strain gauges</b>. The measured worst-case offset observed was:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>−12.73 mV (worst-case)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This corresponds to an effective resistance tolerance of approximately:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1000 ± 18 Ω</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This experimental offset is significantly higher than datasheet expectations and directly impacts gain selection. Because the worst-case
      offset (−12.73 mV) exceeds the safe range for Gain 128 (±9.375 mV), <b>Gain 128 was eliminated</b> from the final design.
    </p>

    <h4>Strain Range and Saturation Considerations</h4>
    <p>
      From the datasheet, the ultimate strain rating is <b>20000 µm/m</b>, which corresponds to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ΔR ≈ 42 Ω</li>
      <li>Offset voltage shift ≈ +31.6 mV</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At this strain level, gains 64 and 128 would saturate, while gains 32 and 16 remain within range.
    </p>

    <h4>Final Gain Strategy</h4>
    <p>Based on both datasheet analysis and real experimental data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gain 128 was rejected due to excessive real-world offsets.</li>
      <li>Gain 64 was limited due to saturation risk at higher strain values.</li>
      <li>Gain 32 and Gain 16 were selected as safe operating gains, providing a balance between resolution and measurement headroom.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This ensured robust strain acquisition under manufacturing tolerance variation, real-world offset conditions, and high-strain events in field operation.
    </p>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h4>How was system accuracy validated experimentally?</h4>

    <h4>Test setup</h4>
    <p>
      A beam bending calibration was performed by applying controlled end displacement in steps from <b>1 mm to 13 mm</b> while measuring strain
      from the strain gauge readout chain (bridge excitation → 24-bit ADC → STM32). The beam geometry used in the analytical model matched the test
      specimen parameters (e.g., length ≈ 340 mm, width ≈ 32 mm, thickness ≈ 3 mm, gauge location length ≈ 310 mm).
    </p>

    <h4>Analytical strain modelling (Euler–Bernoulli beam theory)</h4>
    <p>An analytical strain prediction was generated using standard small-deflection beam theory:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Convert the applied displacement to bending curvature for the given loading/support condition.</li>
      <li>
        Compute surface strain at the gauge location using:
        <br/>
        <code>ε(x) = κ(x) · (t/2)</code>
        <br/>
        where <code>t</code> is beam thickness and <code>κ(x)</code> is curvature from the model.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This produced the “Calculated µStrain” series in the plot.</p>

    <h4>Experimental strain (ADC-based)</h4>
    <p>
      The experimental strain was derived from the ADC readings by converting output code → µstrain using the bridge-based equations (with 3 V excitation).
    </p>

    <h4>Results and comparison</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The experimental curve closely overlays the analytical curve across 1–13 mm, showing strong linear agreement (near-identical lines).</li>
      <li>Error stayed small across the sweep:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Max |error| ≈ 3.37 µstrain</li>
        <li>RMSE ≈ 2.33 µstrain</li>
        <li>MSE ≈ 5.07 (µstrain²)</li>
        <li>Average SD ≈ 1.44 µstrain</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

      <div class="caption">Beam bending validation: analytical vs ADC-derived microstrain (1–13 mm displacement).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h4>What was system sensitivity?</h4>
    <p>
      System sensitivity was quantified through calibration testing by correlating theoretical strain (beam bending model) with raw ADC output codes.
      The calibration results showed a linear response across the operating range, confirming stable excitation, consistent signal conditioning, and repeatable ADC performance.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">The measured system sensitivity was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>0.00284 µε/LSB</b> (≈ 352.5 LSB per µε)</li>
      <li>Equivalent effective input sensitivity of approximately <b>0.00127 µV/µε</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This sensitivity enabled reliable sub-microstrain detection and provided sufficient resolution for low-strain field measurements while maintaining adequate headroom for offset and temperature drift effects.
    </p>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h4>What was the Noise performance &amp; Effective Resolution?</h4>
    <p>
      To quantify the system noise floor and effective resolution, a zero-strain dataset was recorded with the beam unloaded.
      The ADC sampled at <b>256 samples/sec</b>. The MCU collected ADC data continuously and reported one output sample every <b>2 seconds</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">Noise measured from zero-strain data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>RMS noise: <b>0.097 µV RMS</b></li>
      <li>Noise density: <b>0.195 µV/√Hz</b></li>
      <li>Effective resolution (ENOB): <b>~17.8 bits</b> (Gain = 32)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This test experimentally validated the system’s low-noise acquisition performance and confirmed that averaging-based sampling significantly improved the measurement resolution for long-duration strain monitoring in field conditions.
    </p>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h4>How was thermal drift quantified and compensated?</h4>

    <h4>How drift was quantified?</h4>
    <p>
      To measure real-world thermal drift, the complete system (bridge excitation + ADC + MCU) was left running overnight with no mechanical load change.
      During the test:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temperature was logged continuously, showing a natural swing of roughly <b>~14.3°C</b> (about ~26°C down to ~12–13°C and back up).</li>
      <li>In parallel, strain output from all channels was recorded as “MicroStrain”, so any remaining change is dominated by temperature-driven drift rather than applied strain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To convert the observed drift into an electrical quantity, the strain variations were mapped back to an equivalent resistance change (ΔR) of the 1000 Ω gauge (GF ≈ 2.1 was used in the sheet).
      The results summary from the dataset:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Max deviation range (worst channel): ΔR ≈ <b>0.322 Ω</b></li>
      <li>As % of 1000 Ω: <b>0.000322%</b></li>
      <li>Equivalent drift: <b>≈ 322 ppm</b> over the test window</li>
      <li>Drift per °C: <b>≈ 22.52 ppm/°C</b> (computed over the 14.3°C temperature span)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This gives a clear, comparable “ppm/°C” figure for thermal stability.</p>

      <div class="caption">Microstrain vs time across channels during thermal drift test (no mechanical load change).</div>
    </div>

    <h4>How drift was compensated?</h4>
    <p>
      Compensation was done by <b>Reference subtraction (common-mode cancellation)</b>. A dedicated reference channel was used as a baseline and subtracted from all active channels.
      The strain traces were processed as “Ref Subtracted”, meaning a reference channel / baseline term was subtracted from each measurement to cancel excitation/ADC/common-mode temperature effects shared across channels.

    </div>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h4>What was the power consumption of the system?</h4>
    <p>
      With a measured current consumption of <b>~40 mA</b>, the system achieves <b>~62.5 hours (~2.6 days)</b> continuous runtime using
      <b>4×AA (2500 mAh)</b> batteries in series.
    </p>

    <h4>What was the final engineering outcome?</h4>
    <p>
      A validated multi-channel strain measurement system demonstrating low-noise performance, strong analytical correlation, and thermal stability suitable for harsh industrial field deployment.
      Overall, the design achieved the required balance of <b>high sensitivity</b>, <b>low noise</b>, <b>low power consumption</b>, and <b>field robustness</b>, delivering a practical instrumentation platform ready for real-world industrial use.
    </p>

    <h4>What did the final hardware implementation look like?</h4>
    <p>
      Custom compact strain acquisition PCB designed to fit inside a <b>27 mm diameter tube</b>, with mounting holes,
      integrating excitation supply, multi-channel ADC interface, and STM32 control.
